# Yamaha K-Line Tool

Yamaha K-Line Project, works on pre-2015 motorcycles via sniffing the K-line, Euro 3.

This project is aimed at Python data logging with a USB KKL FT232RL K-line diagnostic cable. The cable I used was from Proscan automotive, but any cable with the correct IC will work.

There is a fork of the original project on my GitHub, but this was aimed at a simple way of data logging the K-line via a commonly found OBD cable. I will keep the project up to date with my findings.
